# CATHeaPS

This library contains **CATHeaPS**, a **C**entralisation **A**nalysis **T**ool for **Hea**t **P**ump **S**ystems.

**CATHeaPS** is an open access modelling tool for a complete techno-economic analysis of 5th Generation District Heating and Cooling and alternative supply options for an area. These alternative supply options include centralised 4th Generation District Heating networks with decentralised Air Conditioning units for cooling, building/flat level reversible Air Source Heat Pumps and individual Gas Boilers and Air Conditioning units. CATHeaPS includes energy demand, energy supply, hydraulic and economic analysis for each considered system. The economic analysis follows the guidelines for heat network project assessment published by the UK government. The focus is on the UK market (prices, energy projections and CO2 contents), but the overall trends and relationships established can advise projects on other markets.

# Model Overview

**CATHeaPS** is developed in Excel as it offers a combination of simplicity and sufficient coding capacity (through VBA) and is also widely available. It is intended to allow multivariable comparison and a break-even analysis of the results through simulations for a range of different scenarios. It, therefore, provides a comprehensive and effective economic and environmental evaluation of alternative approaches to providing heat for a user-defined area input.

# Limitations and recommendations for future work

Furthermore, all networks studied are simplified and linear. The incorporation of the capability to solve for non-linear networks is a crucial future improvement and its results should be compared to the ones outlined in this study. The capacity for a mixed network analysis, comprising centralised and decentralised WSHPs at different levels of thermal zoning. The figures and values used are focused on the UK market but there is the capacity to change them for other market analysis.
